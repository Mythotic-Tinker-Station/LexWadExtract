-- Repeat these steps for each mapset
-------------------------------------------
1:  Copy the wad you want to convert to \tools\extractor\

2:  Go to \tools\extractor\src and open the main.lua file

3:	Change this line:
    ---------- edit these!-----------
    local acronym = "EPIC" -- the acronym of the mapset, we use a 4 letter acronym to ID and name assets from that wad, for example, all textures are renamed "EPIC0000" ect
    local pwad = apppath .. "/epip.wad" -- the wad to convert

4:	Click tools/extractor/Run.Bat

5:	Watch it do the thing.

6:	Once its done, the \pk3\ folder should have all the mapset assets set and ready along with the rest

7:  Just copy all that stuff to your pack pk3 folder, then setup the MAPINFO, LAUNAGE, and ACS Script
