-- You only need to do steps 1 - 7 once
-------------------------------------------
1:	Copy /tools/slade_script/LexEx.lua to %appdata%/slade3/scripts/archive

2:	Copy the doom2.wad to \tools\extractor\

3:	Open the doom2.wad in \tools\extractor\ in slade

4:	Go to Archive > Run Script > LexEx

5:	You'll be prompted to provide an acronym, this can be ingored for the doom2 wad, leave it the default "DOOM"

6:	This script takes a few minutes to complete, slade will freeze during this time, dont panic!

7:	You will have a doom2_lex.wad in the same folder, you can delete the doom2.wad

-------------------------------------------
-- Repeat these steps for each mapset
-------------------------------------------
8:	Open the mapset you wanna convert in slade

8:	Go to Archive > Run Script > LexEx

9:	You'll be prompted to provide a 4 letter acronym, this acronym is important for renaming textures and the like

10:	This script takes a few minutes to complete, slade will freeze during this time, dont panic!

11:	You will have a wad with the same name with _lex appended in the same folder

12:	Copy that wad to \tools\extractor\

13:	Go to \tools\extractor\src and open the main.lua file

14:	Change this line:
		mapset = wad(apppath .. "/epic2_lex.wad", "EPC2", doom2, pk3path)

		Change epic2_lex.wad to the wad file name you copied to \tools\extractor\
		Change "EPC2" to a 4 letter acronym for the mapset

15:	in FLATS, MAPS, and TEXTURES folders, you need to make a folder with the acronym you're going to use in each

16:	Click Run.Bat

17:	Watch it do the thing.

18:	Once its done, the \pk3\ folder should have all the mapset assets set and ready along with the rest, that pk3 is our project folder
