# Lexicon Wad Extractor Thing


**Prerequisite: Add the doom2.wad to the \tools\extractor\ folder**

    Notes: 
        Zandronum still relies on the 8 char name limit,
        So to avoid conflicts we made use of an acronym system
        all mods must have a 4 letter arconym, this will be use to:
            - ID the mapset
            - Rename assets:
                - Textures, Flats, Patches, Sounds: xxxxyyyy (xxxx is the acronym, yyyy is a number)
                - Maps:                             xxxxyy (xxxx is the acronum, yy is the map number)
                - Sprites:                          xxyyzzzz (xx is a 2 letter acronym, yy is a number, zzzz is the frames letters)
                - Text lumps:                       xxxxxxxx.yyyy.txt (xxxxxxxx is the name of the lump file, for example animdefs, yyyy is the acronym)
